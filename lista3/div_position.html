        <div id="box-static">
            position: static<br>
            Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.<br>
            An element with position: static; is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

                Cheek is a small yellow hamster with a rosy blush. His favorite hobby is baking in his miniature
                kitchen and then sharing the treats with his larger animal friends. He hasn’t noticed that his
                creations are bite-sized, and everyone’s too nice to point it out.

            position: relative<br>
            An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.<br>
            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties will cause the element to be adjusted away from its
            normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

                An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
                (with position other than static).<br>
                However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document
                body, and moves along with page scrolling.

        <div id="box-fixed">
            position: fixed<br>
            An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always
            stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left
            properties are used set the final location of the element.<br>
            A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
